## About the Paper

Monitoring diseases that affect the brain’s structural integrity requires automated analysis of magnetic resonance images, e.g., for the evaluation of volumetric changes. However, many of the evaluation tools are optimized for analyzing healthy tissue. To enable the evaluation of scans containing pathological tissue, it is therefore required to restore healthy tissue in the pathological areas. In this work, we explore and extend denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) for consistent inpainting of healthy 3D brain tissue. We modify state-of-the-art 2D, pseudo-3D, and 3D DDPMs working in the image space, as well as 3D latent and 3D wavelet DDPMs, and train them to synthesize healthy brain tissue. Our evaluation shows that the pseudo-3D model performs best regarding the structural-similarity index, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and mean squared error. To emphasize the clinical relevance, we fine-tune this model on synthetic multiple sclerosis lesions and evaluate it on a downstream brain tissue segmentation task, where it outperforms the established FMRIB Software Library (FSL) lesion-filling method.

Evaluated methods:

The following list provides details of the different modified methods we evaluate:
- DDPM 2D slice-wise: A baseline method as presented in [1] with the input being defined as X<sub>t</sub> = (x<sub>t</sub>, b, m). Here, x<sub>t</sub>, b, and m are 2D slices. During training and sampling, only slices with a non-zero mask are considered. Finally, the samples are stacked to a 3D volume.
- DDPM 2D seq-pos: The above baseline method is extended by conditioning on the previous slice and positional embedding. The input is defined as X<sub>t</sub> = (x<sub>t</sub>, b, m, x<sub>prev</sub>), with x<sub>t</sub>, m, and b being 2D slices and x<sub>prev</sub> being the previous ground truth 2D slice (without noise) during training, or the previously sampled slice during sampling. In addition, we use a position embedding of the slice index. We perform slice-by-slice sampling of non-zero mask slices, where each slice is conditioned on the previous by concatenation, and the samples are stacked to a 3D volume in the end.
- DDPM Pseudo3D: A pseudo-3D method as described in [2], modified for inpainting. Pseudo-3D convolutions result from 2D convolutional layers followed by 1D convolutions in the z-axis. The input is defined as X<sub>t</sub> = (x<sub>t</sub>, b, m) with x<sub>t</sub>, b, and m being stacks of 2D slices. In contrast to [2], we apply the model in the image space and directly use the pseudo-3D convolutions without the proposed fine-tuning strategy used by [2].
- DDPM 3D mem-eff: A memory efficent 3D diffusion model as presented in [3]. The input is defined as X<sub>t</sub> = (x<sub>t</sub>, b, m). We decided to use the memory-efficent architecture by [3] for the 3D model in the image space as it allowed using two residual blocks per scale, which was not possible if we simply replaced the 2D convolutions by 3D convolutions in the baseline model.
- LDM 3D: A 3D latent diffusion model as presented in [4]. The input is defined as X<sub>t</sub> = (x<sub>lat, t</sub>, b<sub>lat</sub>, m<sub>lat</sub>), with x<sub>lat, t</sub>, b<sub>lat</sub>, and m<sub>lat</sub> being the latent representations of x<sub>GT</sub>, b, and m. These latent representations are obtained through an autoencoder (AE) following a VQ-GAN implementation. The diffusion model in the latent space is less memory-intense than in the image space. The AE required to obtain the latent representations, however, exceeds the to us available GPU memory for this experiment (40 GB) at the initial image resolution. Therefore, downsampling of the input volume x<sub>GT</sub> was required.
- WDM 3D: A 3D wavelet diffusion model as presented in [5]. The input is defined as X<sub>t</sub> = (x<sub>wav, t</sub>, b<sub>wav</sub>, m<sub>wav</sub>), with x<sub>wav, t</sub>, b<sub>wav</sub>, and m<sub>wav</sub> being the concatenated wavelet coefficients of x<sub>GT</sub>, b, and m. An inverse wavelet transform is applied to reconstruct the images from the predicted x<sub>wav, 0</sub>.

All models were trained on the publicly available dataset from the "BraTS 2023 Local Synthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting Challenge" [6-11]. The best performing method, DDPM Pseudo3D, was further fine-tuned and evaluated on an additional dataset originating from a multicentre MS cohort study [12, 13]. This data is not publicly available due to data privacy protection.

## Remarks about the code

The requirements.txt file in the main folder (Diffusion_Models_Inpainting) applies to all subfolders, except LDM_3D (has an own requirements.txt file).
The preprocessing mentioned in the paper can be done using preprocessing_2D.py (to generate 2D slices) and preprocessing_3D.py (to generate 3D volumes).
